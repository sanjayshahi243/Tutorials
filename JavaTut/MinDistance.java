/*
Write a function named minDistance that returns the smallest distance between two factors of a number. 
For example, consider 13013 = 1*7*11*13. Its factors are 1, 7, 11, 13 and 13013. 
minDistance(13013) would return 2 because the smallest distance between any two factors is 2 (13 - 11 = 2). 
As another example, minDistance (8) would return 1 because the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8 and the smallest 
distance between any two factors is 1 (2 â€“ 1 = 1).

The function signature is
   int minDistance(int n)

        int distance = n;
        int prev = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i<=n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
